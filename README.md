## Webito

Project made for ubuntu 13.10 or after, python 2.7
Webito is a simple http-based server api providing user registration, authentication and a feature to make a user able to see its last successful connection timestamps.
No interface design has been done yet so the web interface is really simple.
It is based on Flask, using a mongodb database to persist user data.

To install the dependency packages used in the project run :
```shell
sudo apt-get install python-dev libffi-dev mongodb python-pip
 ```
Then install the virtualenv for python (>=version 14.0.6)
```shell
    pip install virtualenv 
 ```
 
A mongodb instance must be running in order to have the website working accordingly to the requirements.
To launch a mongodb instance listening by default on 127.0.0.1:27017 run :
```shell
sudo mongod --nojournal
 ```
You can run "make" in the project folder and you will see the virtual environment folders created. To launch the programm, just run, from inside the project main folder:
```shell
    ./build/venv/bin/python src/run.py "config.json" 1
 ```


 The configuration file is "config.json", it is generated by running "config.py" in the src/ folder.
 In this json file you can for instance modify the webserver listenning address.
 
 Without changing the configuration files, you can access the website on http://0.0.0.0:8080
 From there you can register, login, logout, and display a list of last connections timestamps. Only users with a special role can access this list, but the role is given by default to any new registered user.
 
 To log in as an admin : admin/admin
 Nothing changes except a special page is displayed instead of the normal user connection list page, in case we want to support in the futur special admin features
